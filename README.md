# JavaScript Geometry Formulas

## Getting Started
* You do not need to fork or clone this repository. Simply follow the instructions. 
* Use a separate Repl.it for each problem.
* Write JavaScript code to obtain the data prompted by each question.

## Submitting your work

Each solution should be in its own repl.it project so you will need to submit 5 links to your instructors. Slack solution URLs directly to both instructors.

### 1. Area of a rectangle.

Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle. Create variables to hold the length and the height and use them in the area calculation:

Rectangle area = length x width

Print the calculated area for the user.

---

### 2. Area of a triangle.

Write a program that calculates the area of a triangle. Create variables to hold the base and the height and use them in the area calculation:

Triangle area = 1/2 x base x height

Print the calculated area for the user.

---

### 3. Area of a circle.

Write a program that calculates the area of a circle. Create a variable to hold the radius and use it in the area calculation:

Circle area = Pi x radius x radius

Print the calculated area for the user. **The value for PI is built into JavaScript. How do we access it?**

---

### 4. Circumference of a circle.

Write a program that calculates the circumference of a circle. Create a variable to hold the radius and use it in the area calculation:

Circle circumference = Pi x radius x 2

Print the calculated circumference for the user.

---

### 5. Volume of a sphere.

Write a program that calculates the volume of a sphere. Create a variable to hold the radius and use it in the area calculation:

Sphere volume = 4/3 x Pi x radius x radius x radius

Print the calculated volume for the user.

### 6. Concatenating Strings

Given these three strings:

```js
var str1 = 'Software';
var str2 = 'Development';
var str3 = 'Rules';
```

Write a program that will concatenate them into a single string. **First**, use the concatenation operator (+) and **then** rewrite your solution to use the String.concat() function. Print out the resulting string for the user. **BONUS:** Add spaces between the words in the resulting string.

### 7. Find First Occurrance of Letter

A pangram is a string containing all letters of the alphabet. Given the string:

```js
var str = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'
```

Find the index of the first occurrance of the letter 'z'. Try a few other letters - since it is a pangram every letter should be present. Print out the index of the letter for the user.

---

### 8. Find a Sub-String

Given the following string:

```js
var str = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'
```

Write a program that checks to see if it contains the following sub-strings:

```js
var substr1 = 'ump';
var substr2 = 'brown';
var substr3 = 'Quick';
```

Print `true` or `false` to indicate if the sub-string is present.

Based on the results, is the comparison case-sensitive or case-insensitive?

### 9. Replace Word in a String

Given the following string:

```js
var str = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'
```

We want to modify the string to change the animals' descriptions. Change 'quick' to 'small' and change 'lazy' to 'sleeping'. Print the modified string.

---

### 10. Print a Portion of a String

Given the following string:

```js
var str = 'I am a lasagna hog';
```

Write a program that will print only the word lasagna.
