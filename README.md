# JavaScript Geometry Formulas

## Getting Started
* You do not need to fork or clone this repository. Simply follow the instructions. 
* Use a separate Repl.it for each problem.
* Write JavaScript code to obtain the data prompted by each question.

## Submitting your work

Each solution should be in its own repl.it project so you will need to submit 5 links to your instructors. Slack solution URLs directly to both instructors.

### Area of a rectangle.

Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle. Create variables to hold the length and the height and use them in the area calculation:

Rectangle area = length x width

Print the calculated area for the user.

---

### Area of a triangle.

Write a program that calculates the area of a triangle. Create variables to hold the base and the height and use them in the area calculation:

Triangle area = 1/2 x base x height

Print the calculated area for the user.

### Area of a circle.

Write a program that calculates the area of a circle. Create a variable to hold the radius and use it in the area calculation:

Circle area = Pi x radius x radius

Print the calculated area for the user. **The value for PI is built into JavaScript. How do we access it?**

### Circumference of a circle.

Write a program that calculates the circumference of a circle. Create a variable to hold the radius and use it in the area calculation:

Circle circumference = Pi x radius x 2

Print the calculated circumference for the user.

---

### Volume of a sphere.

Write a program that calculates the volume of a sphere. Create a variable to hold the radius and use it in the area calculation:

Sphere volume = 4/3 x Pi x radius x radius x radius

Print the calculated volume for the user.
